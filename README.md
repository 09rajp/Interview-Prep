### DO YOUR HOMEWORK - Know the company you're interviewing with!
#### Even if you fumble on the technical question, you can gain some redemption with interviewers by asking *very* insightful questions about the engineering problems they are tackling and prodding about how they are scaling their product. I don't mean "So what language do you guys use?". More like "How did you overcome challenge X when developing service Y?".
